# Patch notes

## 2026-10-14

- First build. Fetcher for every Topsail number (NOAA tides at Hampstead and
  Ocean City pier, NWS forecast, AMZ250 marine, the Coastal Pender surf zone
  forecast, NDBC 41110, Beaufort sound proxy, Open-Meteo sun, wind and model
  waves), the gate (OFF/DONE/BUSY/GO), renderer (page, index, text),
  validator, publisher, live check, the morning playbook, and offline tests.
- Pages deploy via Actions, gated on the tests.
- reference/: sources (what is fetchable, what is blocked, an almanac for
  the run), regs (flounder closed for the window, trout open, limits with
  proclamation numbers), spots (piers, fees, blanket licences, the south
  end), fall-bite and calendar, all with source URLs and a 2026-10-14 check.
- Playbook: Fisherman's Post is the fishing report of record; NCDMF
  proclamations and the shellfish closure list are checked every morning.
- Rehearsal (cloud routine, run by hand at 3:00 PM): gate GO sample, 8/8
  feeds, numbers edition live at 3:01, the full report validated first
  try, PUSHED and LIVE at 3:07, 744-character text. The one snag: a fresh
  clone had no reports/ folder (git keeps no empty folders), so the first
  write failed and the session made the folder itself. reports/ and data/
  now carry a .gitkeep.
